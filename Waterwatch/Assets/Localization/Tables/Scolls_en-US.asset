    m_Localized: I was fishing around the Maldives Islands, and suddenly I ran out
      of gas on my boat, which is very strange. That had never happened before, I
      am the most careful fisherman in the world, but today greed for a few more
      fish has left me trapped on this island. I'm going to start my journey here
      and that's why I'm writing this letter and leaving it here on the boat. I am
      going to explore this huge island and, if I cannot survive, someone will be
      able to find this record.

    m_Localized: If you find this letter, we are evacuating this island because of
      a fight with the other side. The people on the other side of the island are
      very dangerous and are threatening our people. They send out smoke signals
      every day, threatening everyone on this side. They are much more advanced than
      we are. We wouldn't stand a chance against them. CAUTION.

    m_Localized: My friends are already gone in their boats. I believe that my neighbors
      will leave today to seek shelter in a big city. I would like to say that we
      are fleeing because of the people from the other side, those damned people!
      If you are from the other side, I HATE you. If you are not from the other side,
      watch out for them and their shiny explosive weapons, from time to time they
      shoot up giant bombs, in order to threaten us. Goodbye isle, I love you!

    m_Localized: Damn you! They managed to expel us from this wonderful island, I
      will leave my bungalow overlooking the sea in oblivion. I wonder if those on
      the other side still have that treasure with gold and supplies... We will need
      it for our journey. Goodbye, island!

    m_Localized: Dear residents on the other side, for years we have tried to contact
      you by means of smoke signals, flares and fireworks, but we have not been successful.
      If you want to keep our properties, we are leaving for the city, we managed
      to gather enough gold to start our lives there. At the other end of this side
      of the island, we buried a chest with our flares, if needed. Thanks for being
      the best island neighbors in the world! Good Life!

    m_Localized: I was told to write this letter, in case anyone came looking for
      the chest. Well, it's around here, on the beach area. Good luck.
